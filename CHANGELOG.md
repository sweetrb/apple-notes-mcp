## [1.4.3] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **`.mcp.json` now serves both plugin installs and clones** — the marketplace plugin install was broken (no `mcpServers` declared in `plugin.json`), and the clone/contributor workflow ran the *published* `apple-notes-mcp` package via `npx` instead of the local build. These two contexts can't share one entrypoint string because plugin installs need `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` while clones need `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}`, and Claude Code does not support nested defaults like `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}}`. The two paths are now decoupled: the root `.mcp.json` uses `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/build/index.js` (clone workflow), and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declares its own `mcpServers` using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/build/index.js` (plugin install). Because `plugin.json` declares `mcpServers`, the plugin no longer auto-loads the root `.mcp.json`, so there is no double-registration. Matches the fix shipped in apple-mail-mcp.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Runtime warning for unsupported checklist content** — `create-note` and `update-note` now detect checklist-like input (`<input type="checkbox">`, `class="checklist"|"todo"`, markdown `- [ ]` / `* [ ]` lines) and append a warning to the success response explaining that AppleScript cannot produce real Apple Notes checklists, so the failure mode is no longer silent
- **`detectChecklistAttempt()` utility** in `src/utils/contentWarnings.ts` with 14 unit tests

### Documentation
- **New "Creating Checklists" section in README** — explains why checklist creation is impossible via AppleScript (Apple Notes stores checklists as protobuf paragraph style `103`, which the scripting interface doesn't expose) and documents the ⇧⌘L manual-conversion workaround
- **New "Checklist Creation Is Not Supported" section in CLAUDE.md** — explicit guidance so AI agents stop trying alternative HTML class names, data attributes, or Unicode characters
- **Tool schema descriptions** — `create-note.content` and `update-note.newContent` now mention the checklist limitation so it surfaces in MCP tool listings
- **Known Limitations table** — added a row for checklist creation alongside the existing checklist-state read row

### Fixes Issues
- Closes #11 — "Can't create notes with Checklists (possibly a documentation issue)"

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Nested folder creation** — `create-folder` now supports hierarchical paths (e.g., `"Retro Tech/PC/CPUs"`) by creating intermediate folders and checking existence first to prevent duplicate ghost folders in CoreData
- **Note creation in deeply nested folders** — Fixed AppleScript `-1728` error when creating notes in nested folder contexts by switching to implicit return pattern
- **Updated `create-folder` tool description** — Schema now documents nested path support

### Contributors
- @robschmitt — nested folder creation fix and deep folder note creation fix (PR #9)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Hierarchical folder paths** — `list-folders` now returns full paths (e.g., `Work/Clients/Omnia`) using folder IDs to disambiguate duplicates
- **Nested folder support** — `create-note`, `search-notes`, `list-notes`, `move-note`, and `delete-folder` all accept nested paths like `"Work/Clients"`
- **`folder` and `account` parameters on `create-note`** — Create notes directly in a specific folder and account
- **Literal slash escaping** — Folder names containing `/` are escaped as `\/` in paths (e.g., `Spain\/Portugal 2023`)
- **Folder IDs** — `list-folders` now includes the CoreData ID for each folder
- **Input length validation** — Titles (2K), content (5MB), folder paths (1K), account names (200 chars), and folder nesting depth (20 levels) are all validated
- **Security tests** — Injection payloads, malformed IDs, boundary conditions for folder paths

### Security
- **CoreData ID validation** — New `sanitizeId()` validates ID format with regex before embedding in AppleScript, preventing injection via crafted IDs
- **Account name sanitization** — Account names are now escaped in `buildAccountScopedScript()` to prevent AppleScript injection
- **Defense-in-depth** — All ID-based methods (`getNoteById`, `getNoteContentById`, `deleteNoteById`, `updateNoteById`, `moveNoteById`, `listAttachmentsById`) now validate and escape IDs

### Changed
- **Rewrote `listSharedNotes()` output parsing** — Switched from fragile regex/comma-based parsing to delimited `|||` output, fixing potential breakage when note titles contain commas or braces

### Contributors
- Rob Schmitt ([@robschmitt](https://github.com/robschmitt)) — Hierarchical folder paths and nested folder support (PR #8)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **createNote uses body-only approach** — Title is now set exclusively via `<h1>` prefix in the note body instead of setting both the `name` property and body. This eliminates title duplication.

### Fixed
- **Title duplication in createNote** — Previously, setting both `name` and `body` caused the title to appear twice in the note. Now only `body` (with `<h1>` title prefix) is used.

### Added
- **Proper backslash and tab handling** in plaintext content encoding — Backslashes are encoded as `&#92;` and tabs are converted to `<br>` to prevent AppleScript escaping issues.

## [1.2.17] - 2025-01-01

### Security
- **Fixed command injection vulnerability** in `moveNote()` - HTML content from notes was not properly escaped before embedding in AppleScript commands

### Changed
- **Improved sleep implementation** - Replaced CPU-spinning busy-wait with efficient system sleep command
- **Added sync status caching** - Sync detection now caches results for 2 seconds to reduce database queries
- **Extracted shared parsing logic** - Consolidated duplicated note property parsing into `parseNotePropertiesOutput()` helper

### Added
- **New helper functions** for cleaner code:
  - `escapeHtmlForAppleScript()` - Safely escape already-HTML content for AppleScript
  - `generateFallbackId()` - Consistent unique ID generation when AppleScript doesn't return one
  - `parseNotePropertiesOutput()` - Shared parsing for AppleScript note property output
  - `clearSyncStatusCache()` - Clear cached sync status for testing/forced refresh
- **Export type definitions** - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for export operations (`NotesExport`, `ExportedNote`, etc.)
- **Additional retry tests** - Coverage for all retryable error patterns (timed out, lost connection, busy)

### Developer Experience
- **ESLint flat config** - Migrated from deprecated `.eslintrc.cjs` to modern `eslint.config.js`
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Added husky + lint-staged for automatic linting on commit
- **Test coverage thresholds** - Enforced minimum coverage (services ≥80%, utils ≥90%)
- **Dynamic version** - Server version now read from package.json instead of hardcoded
